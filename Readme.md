# MD - best practices

The aim of this ONLINE course is to give an intro to classical Molecular Dynamics 
(MD) simulations. We will start from scratch by setting a MD simulation. Regarding the
software, we will use VMD and NAMD, for the full protocol.
We will also provide users with a set of best practices to improve the performance of
their simulations.

NOTE: The course will be online!

## Topics to be covered are:

- Setting up classical MD simulation with NAMD+VMD
